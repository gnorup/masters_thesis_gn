## Additional Analyses

### Additional analyses reported in the thesis: 
- `beeswarm_plots_combined.ipynb`: Feature importance figure shown in the thesis
- `check_regression_assumptions.ipynb`: Regression assumptions for multiple linear regression
- `correlation_analyses.py`: Main pipeline correlation analyses for features, scores and demographic variables
- `describe_dataset.ipynb`: Main descriptive results reported in the thesis (for demographics, scores and tasks)
- `first_regression_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb`: Hyperparameter-tuning performed on an earlier picnicScene feature set, now used as default fallback-values when no re-tuning is performed
- `icc.py`: Calculation of inter-rater reliability
- `plot_learning_curves.ipynb`: Learning curves displayed in Appendix B
- `score_validation.py`: Score validation reported in the thesis (ICC results)
